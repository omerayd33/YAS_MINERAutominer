SovdexBurnMiner

The SovdexBurnMiner is a adaptation of the EIDOS miner

If the transfer amount is increased, SOV mining reward increases too. The mining reward also increases when SVX is staked. These are not accounted for now. Only the base mining rate of .005% and sending 210 SOV.

Want to add ability to change amount sent on a slider from min to mine(210) to maximum possible mining reward (210000). It is set up to minimum for burn mining now because that is proabably the most effecient you can mine SVX without trading. The higher mining rate for burning more SOV in single transfers is more for trading than mining but can be used by miners as well.

Any are free to contribute as I already just adapted this from something else :)

also can't get the SVX symbol to render on the site..... so any help with that is appreciated lol
